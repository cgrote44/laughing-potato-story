This is a story.  The story is about a potato that laughs a lot.  The potato lives on the farm.

The potatoe laughed at everything on the farm. It laughed at the chickens, and the corn, and the cows, 
and the pigs. It even laughed at the humans. It laughed all day and all night.

The mimes on the streets definitely had an amused audience when they performed near the farm.
Nothing that passed this farm left it without a wide smile and sore cheeks from all the laughing that
must have occured while passing it.

The farm would go down in history as the most comical farm to ever be, with the laughing potato taking head lead as the funniest of all things grown on the farm

To this day the laughing potato still laughs all day, every day and he will continue
to laugh until the end of time.
